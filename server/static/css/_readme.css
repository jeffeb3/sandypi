/** 

This project uses Sass.
Css files are generated automatically from the scss files in the server/static/scss folder
Do not modify the css files directly otherwise the changes will be lost during the scss build process.
Scss files are similar to css files with some powerful additions like variables and functions (see https://sass-lang.com/guide)
In addition to using scss files, the project uses Bootstrap 4. Check this link for more: https://getbootstrap.com/
